# Codebase Analysis System (Work in Progress)

A system for analyzing software repositories and generating knowledge graphs of code dependencies and documentation.

## Current Features

### Repository Analysis
- File classification by type/purpose
- Source code parsing and dependency extraction
- Content analysis and documentation generation
- Knowledge graph visualization

### Implemented Components

#### Knowledge Graph Generation
- Multi-language dependency extraction (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)
- File relationship mapping
- Interactive visualization

#### Documentation Pipeline
- Category-based documentation templates
- GPU-accelerated content analysis
- Distributed processing capabilities

## Work in Progress

### High Priority
- Optimize GPU utilization for large codebases
- Improve dependency detection accuracy
- Enhanced visualization interactivity
- Documentation quality improvements

### Known Issues
- GPU allocation needs optimization
- Some file dependencies may be missed
- Large codebase performance bottlenecks

## Usage Instructions

Currently implemented as a Jupyter notebook workflow. Integration as a standalone tool is planned.

## Technical Stack
- NetworkX for graph processing
- Ray for distributed computing
- PyTorch for GPU acceleration
- Matplotlib for visualization

## Next Steps
1. Resolve GPU allocation issues
2. Implement incremental analysis
3. Add more language support
4. Create CLI interface
